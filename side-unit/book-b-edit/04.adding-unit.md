# Adding a unit

We are going to add another unit to our course. 

This time we are going to edit `topic-02`, the `Units with Videos` card. In this topic we already have 2 units.

The easiest way to add another unit is to copy and paste it. The two units we currently have are different. The first unit has a panel video and the second is a regular unit. You can choose which unit to copy. Right-click on the chosen unit and click `Copy.`

Right-click on `topic-2` and click `Paste`. This adds in another folder called `unit-1-copy`. We can rename this folder to `unit-3`.

We would then edit the markdown file and change the content we want to be displayed within this unit. 

Save the file and recompile it by typing `npx tutors-puiblish` into the terminal. 

Drag and drop the newly generated JSON folder to the Netlify drop area for your published site.
