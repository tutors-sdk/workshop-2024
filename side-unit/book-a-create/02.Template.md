- [Tutors Reference Course](archives/tutors-reference-course.zip)


Save this somewhere convenient - and keep note of where it is stored.

Extract the .zip file. How you do this will depend on which archiving tool you may have installed and which Operating Systems you use. On Windows it might look like this:

See if you can relate the web experience to the layout of the files in the folder on your workstation. Each card is clickable, and the various toolbars along the top have tooltips, visible when you hover.
